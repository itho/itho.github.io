                <p>Netsend is a document distribution company for financial documents, facilitating the generation of 
                documents from internal accounting software/data to the online storage and multi-channel distribution. 
                While the company is relatively small in terms of employee numbers, it serves some of the largest 
                companies in the UK and accross the world, including Adecco, the largest staffing firm in the world, the 
                Guardian group, MSD, Twentieth Century Fox, Unisys, Vanity Fair Northern Europe and many others.</p>
                <p>Alongside previous responsiblities I have been working in many areas of developing the company 
                product, including working with design and marketing teams to update and improve the UI/UX of our 
                online sites.</p>
                <p>I was given the responsibility of making key design choices during the conceptualisation stage of 
                the project and I was also the front-end developer working with Laravel as the framework for our 
                sites to create the views in PHP, HTML, CSS (Sass) and Javascript (jQuery), after having the 
                plans approved by the directors of the company.</p>
                <p>Using my skills with Java in creating Android applications, I developed a complimentary app to 
                deliver our new responsive sites to our clients on their mobile devices, using an implementation of 
                Chrome custom tabs, which provided a professional and integrated experience.</p>
                <p>With respect to development work, I also updated the company's outgoing email templates and signatures 
                to a responsive and more modern looking standard. The main contact at our largest client noticed these 
                changes and requested similar work to outgoing mail we provided to their customers as part of our 
                service to them, generating extra projects and revenue for our company.</p>
                <p>From an analytical aspect, I have been involved more with project planning, leveraging my company 
                knowledge against my strengths in logic and planning to ensure that we approached tasks in the best manner. 
                These include internal meetings, where I would often need to act as an intermediary between 
                technical and non-tecnhinal teams, but also on client conference calls where I would liase with 
                technical and non-technical contacts to ensure all necessary information is extracted pertaining to a project.</p>

                <p>I undertook quality-assurance testing for all client systems and development projects. I performed 
                white-box system, performance, load, regression, stress and data interface testing. Providing 
                internal developer teams with detailed reports on necessary changes, identifying bugs/flaws and 
                recommending fixes where I could see solutions.</p>
                <p>I held responsiblity for the approval of all development, constituting client website setup, 
                connectivity, document generation, document sending and user access to our systems. 
                The core of the system was PHP with many relational SQL databases. I was responsible for the status of 
                the testing servers and managed them using version control systems such as git via bitbucket as well as 
                through custom deployment scripts and envoyer.io.</p>
                <p>Along with these responsibilities, I have also been providing statistical analysis and reporting to 
                members of client services teams as well as to directors directly. These include reports generated by 
                hand from our client databases (SQL) and from our internal management tools such as JIRA and vivantio, 
                both of which I am an administrative user.</p>
