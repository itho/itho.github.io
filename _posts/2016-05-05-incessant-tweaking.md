I think it's safe to say I've got this site in a reasonably good order now.
I messed about a lot with the internal organisation, something I tend to obsess over, but I think I'm finally happy with how it's put together.

I'm sure there are unnecesary items in some of the setup files, but as of now everything works so I'm going to give up on trimming down on the SLOC count of the site.

### Time to breathe...

With everything put together how I want it now, and no loose ends, I should be able to divert focus back to my android development.
My current WIP, BlackBook, is still a long way off an alpha. But watch this space as I'm sure after a few more hours tinkering, I'll have a nice UI to showcase in my next post.

Until next time...

```java
public class Help
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```
